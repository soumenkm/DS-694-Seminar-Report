\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec: Problem Definition}
\paragraph{} In the evolving field of natural language processing (NLP), the ability of multilingual language models to effectively transfer knowledge across different languages remains a significant challenge. Despite the rapid advancements in language model technology, including attention mechanisms and multilingual model development, there are inherent limitations in how these models manage and apply cross-lingual knowledge. This challenge is compounded by the complexity of adapting these models to perform optimally across diverse linguistic contexts.

\paragraph{} The problem extends into the fine-tuning processes and the representation of facts within these models, which are crucial for maintaining accuracy and relevance in multilingual applications. The fundamental issue revolves around developing robust methodologies that can enhance the efficacy of knowledge transfer in multilingual settings, ensuring that these models can deliver consistent and reliable performance across all languages they are designed to support.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec: Motivation}
\paragraph{} The internet is full of information in many different languages. However, most language technology today works best with English, leaving those who speak other languages with fewer benefits. This is a big problem because everyone should have equal access to the advancements in artificial intelligence, no matter what language they speak. While monolingual models have reached impressive levels of performance, they inherently lack the ability to operate beyond their target linguistic boundaries. This limitation underscores the critical need for robust multilingual models capable of understanding and processing multiple languages simultaneously.

\paragraph{} Multilingual language models, such as mBERT and XLM-R, have emerged as important tools in breaking these language barriers, facilitating a more inclusive digital ecosystem. However, the full potential of these models is yet to be realized, particularly in contexts involving low-resource languages or dialects that are typically underrepresented in data used for training these models. This research is motivated by the pursuit to harness and enhance the capabilities of these models to not only understand but also effectively transfer knowledge across languages.

\paragraph{} Furthermore, the dynamic and evolving nature of language necessitates continuous advancements in language models to adapt to new vocabularies, expressions, and usage patterns. This evolving landscape presents a unique opportunity to explore innovative cross-lingual transfer mechanisms that can significantly improve the adaptability and scalability of language technologies.

\paragraph{} By addressing these challenges, this seminar aims to contribute to the development of more generalized, efficient, and inclusive language technologies that are accessible to users worldwide, regardless of language. This motivation drives the exploration of advanced fine-tuning techniques and novel architectural frameworks that promote effective knowledge transfer across linguistic divides, ultimately enhancing the practical utility of multilingual language models in real-world applications.
